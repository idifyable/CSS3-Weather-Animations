# CSS3-Weather-Animations
Pure CSS3 weather animated icons

Pure css3 weather icons animated with css keyframes and transitions. It started life as a weather web app connected to the Open Weather API. Due to mixed content errors caused by limitations of the free plan of the API and github's forced secure protocol I had to settle with publishing it as a study of css3 animation capabilities.

#Technologies Used

CSS3 HTML Javascript/jQuery
